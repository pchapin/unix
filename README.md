# Unix Overivew

This respository contains a document giving an overview of the Unix system. In this context
"Unix" is meant generically to cover any flavor of Unix. This document does *not* cover the
specific details of any particular Unix-like system such as Linux (and its variations) or macOS.

The document is intended for students or hobbists who are new to Unix-like systems and want to
get a general understanding of how they work and how to use them.

The document is writting using DocBook 4.5. To convert it into a more use-friendly format some
appropriate tool chain is needed. I use the commercial <oXygen/> XML editor.
